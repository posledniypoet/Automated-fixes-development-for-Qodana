The principal idea is to take letters as vertices of graph and take directed edges if names[j] letter in position k != names[i] letter in position k where i < j; After that we check for cycle, because if we have a cycle, problem is impossible to solving because we don't hava topological sort. For checking for cycle our graph we have to use DFS. Asymptotic in the worst occasion is O(v^2) where V is number of vertices and our number of vertices is not bigger than 26, because we have only 26 letters in alphabet.
